## Tricorder SAO Versions

There are two kinds of Tricorder SAOs, which should look identical from the front. The main differences are on the back:

1. **Battery-Powered Version**
   - Contains LEDs visible from the front.
   - Lacks some LEDs due to power limitations.
   
2. **Badge-Powered SAO Version**
   - Designed to be plugged onto a badge.
   - Draws power from the badge, allowing for more LEDs.

### Battery Insertion Instructions

1. **Insert the Battery**:
    - Place the battery with the right side under the clips.
    - Ensure the plus side is facing up.
    - Press down until it snaps into place.

2. **Remove the Battery**:
    - Gently lift with a fingernail to avoid breaking the clips.

### Powering On and Off

- **On/Off Switch**: Both versions have an on/off switch.
    - Turn it on to see the SAO light up with various LED sequences.
    - Turn it off to conserve battery.

### Attaching the Lanyard

1. **Insert the Lanyard**:
    - Pinch the end and squeeze it through the hole.
    - Pull the rest through and secure it.

2. **Usage**:
    - Wear it around your wrist.
    - Attach it to other objects to prevent it from falling.

## Using the Badge-Powered SAO

1. **Attach to Badge**:
    - Align the notch on the SAO with the notch on the badge.
    - Press down firmly to connect.

2. **Power and LEDs**:
    - Draws power from the badge.
    - Supports additional LEDs, including scanning LEDs and side-emitting LEDs.

## Lanyard Usage for Badge

- Use the lanyard to secure the SAO to your badge.
- Prevents the SAO from falling if it becomes loose.
